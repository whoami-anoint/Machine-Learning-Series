### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence is an area of computer science, where the goal is to enable computers and machines to perform human-like task and simpulate human behavior.

### Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning is subset of AI that tries to solve a specific problem and make prediction using data.

### Data Science (DS)

All fields overlab! All may use ML!
