What is Machine learning?

Machine learning (ML) is the ability of a computer program to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Machine learning algorithms are typically trained on data, and then used to make predictions on new data. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be trained on a dataset of historical stock prices to predict future stock prices.

Machine learning algorithms can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including:

* **Classification:** Assigning a label to an input, such as "spam" or "not spam".
* **Regression:** Predicting a continuous value, such as the price of a stock or the temperature tomorrow.
* **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together, such as customers with similar buying habits.
* **Dimensionality reduction:** Reducing the number of features in a dataset, while preserving as much information as possible.

Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. However, it is important to understand the limitations of machine learning. Machine learning algorithms can be biased, and they can make mistakes. It is important to carefully evaluate the results of machine learning algorithms before using them to make decisions.
