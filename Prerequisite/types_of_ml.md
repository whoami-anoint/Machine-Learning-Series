## Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled input (meaning the inputs has corrensponding output label) to train models and learn outputs.
    - Eg. Labeled dog as dog, cat as cat

2. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
- Used unlabeled data to learn about patterns in data.
    - Eg: We saw cat and with patten the patten we reconize realize cat without any label.
    
3. Reinforcement Learning 
- Agent learning in interative environment based on rewards and penalities.
    - Eg: We train our dog/pet.
