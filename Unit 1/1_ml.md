# Unit 1 : Introduction to Machine Learning and Applications



 ### Types of machine learning:

#### 1. **Supervised learning:**
 In supervised learning, the algorithm is given a set of labeled data, and it learns to map the input data to the output labels. For example, a supervised learning algorithm could be used to train a model to classify images of cats and dogs.

#### 2. **Unsupervised learning:** 
In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given a set of unlabeled data, and it learns to find patterns in the data. For example, an unsupervised learning algorithm could be used to cluster a set of customer data into groups of similar customers.

#### 3. **Reinforcement learning:** 
In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by trial and error. The algorithm is given a set of rewards and punishments, and it learns to take actions that maximize the rewards.

## Applications of Machine Learning

#### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determines sentiment in text data (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Machine Translation:** Translates languages using algorithms.
- **Chatbots:** AI-powered for customer support and interaction.
- **Speech Recognition:** Converts spoken language to text (e.g., Siri, Alexa).

#### 2. Computer Vision
- **Image Classification:** Identifies objects/scenes in images.
- **Object Detection:** Locates/classifies objects in images/videos.
- **Facial Recognition:** Recognizes/verifies individuals from facial features.
- **Medical Imaging:** Assists in diagnosing diseases from medical images.

#### 3. Healthcare
- **Disease Diagnosis:** Analyzes medical data to diagnose diseases (e.g., cancer).
- **Drug Discovery:** Identifies potential drug candidates using ML.
- **Patient Monitoring:** Predicts patient outcomes and real-time health monitoring.
- **Healthcare Management:** Optimizes hospital resources and patient allocation.

#### 4. Finance
- **Credit Scoring:** Assesses creditworthiness of applicants.
- **Algorithmic Trading:** Develops trading algorithms for investment decisions.
- **Fraud Detection:** Identifies fraudulent transactions in real-time.
- **Risk Management:** Assesses and mitigates financial risks.

#### 6. Autonomous Vehicles
- **Self-Driving Cars:** Navigates and makes driving decisions using ML algorithms.
- **Traffic Prediction:** Predicts traffic patterns and optimizes routes.
- **Driver Assistance Systems:** Enhances driver safety with ML-based features.

#### 7. Recommendation Systems
- **E-commerce:** Suggests products based on browsing and purchase history.
- **Streaming Services:** Recommends movies, music, or content.
- **Social Media:** Suggests connections and content (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn).
