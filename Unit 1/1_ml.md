### Introduction:
**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on data.

It involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task by learning from data.

ML is categorized into three main types: [Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning](/Unit%201/2_class.md).



## Applications of Machine Learning

#### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determines sentiment in text data (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Machine Translation:** Translates languages using algorithms.
- **Chatbots:** AI-powered for customer support and interaction.
- **Speech Recognition:** Converts spoken language to text (e.g., Siri, Alexa).

#### 2. Computer Vision
- **Image Classification:** Identifies objects/scenes in images.
- **Object Detection:** Locates/classifies objects in images/videos.
- **Facial Recognition:** Recognizes/verifies individuals from facial features.
- **Medical Imaging:** Assists in diagnosing diseases from medical images.

#### 3. Healthcare
- **Disease Diagnosis:** Analyzes medical data to diagnose diseases (e.g., cancer).
- **Drug Discovery:** Identifies potential drug candidates using ML.
- **Patient Monitoring:** Predicts patient outcomes and real-time health monitoring.
- **Healthcare Management:** Optimizes hospital resources and patient allocation.

#### 4. Finance
- **Credit Scoring:** Assesses creditworthiness of applicants.
- **Algorithmic Trading:** Develops trading algorithms for investment decisions.
- **Fraud Detection:** Identifies fraudulent transactions in real-time.
- **Risk Management:** Assesses and mitigates financial risks.

#### 6. Autonomous Vehicles
- **Self-Driving Cars:** Navigates and makes driving decisions using ML algorithms.
- **Traffic Prediction:** Predicts traffic patterns and optimizes routes.
- **Driver Assistance Systems:** Enhances driver safety with ML-based features.

#### 7. Recommendation Systems
- **E-commerce:** Suggests products based on browsing and purchase history.
- **Streaming Services:** Recommends movies, music, or content.
- **Social Media:** Suggests connections and content (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn).
